          <p>It's hard to put into words, isn't it, when something just feels right? That's exactly what it was for Nick and Brew.</p>
          <p>Like long lost brothers- one from the South, the other from the North; one raised Catholic, the other Protestant; one into the Americana music of Townes Van Zandt, Darrell Scott, and Gillian Welch, the other the Bluegrass World of Bill Monroe, Tony Rice, and the Stanley Brothers.</p>
          <p>When they met in the vibrant music scene of Asheville, North Carolina, it just felt right. We think when you hear 'em, it'll just feel right for you, too. Thanks for visiting! Come back soon.</p>

          <h1>BrewGrass Album OUT NOW!</h1>
          <p>“Brewgrass” came out in March of '24 and was recorded at Nick's home studio “The Sprouse House.”</p>
          <p>What is Brewgrass? A combination of the Americana and Bluegrass music Brew has loved and listened to for so many years. From Doc Watson to Darrell Scott, Gillian Welch to the Nashville Bluegrass Band, Tim O'Brien to Danny Barnes to Patty Griffin to Scott Miller to… well, you get the picture.</p>
          <p>Moods range from the defiant #MeToo movement anthem “Put it Back Together” to moonshine numbers like “Wagon Load” and “White Dog” and tender ballads like “Kerry” and “She was a Rose Once.”</p>
          <p>There's also a love song of a different variety, “Darlin' Caroline” which Davis wrote to North Carolina, the state he's called home for over 20 years. “A big reason I settled in Asheville is because I fell in love with the music of the region. I heard Doc Watson at Merlefest way back in ‘97 and got a job at Sugar Hill Records in Durham. I guess I never looked back.”</p>
          <blockquote>“Darlin’ Caroline is a winsome love song and a humbly rendered, endearingly earnest account of the many reasons Brew fell heart of over hills with the place he and his family now call home.”<br />~ Pam Tillis ~</blockquote>

          <h1>Nick Dauphinais</h1>
          <h2>From the White Mountains of New Hampshire</h2>
          <p>Nick Dauphinais picked up mandolin at age seven and promptly learned to play guitar and sing harmonies in his dad's bluegrass band. After earning a music degree from the University of New Hampshire, he headed south to join Mountain Faith (America's Got Talent) and later the Larry Stephenson Band. Nick teaches guitar and mandolin at Asheville's Academy for the Arts and has played some of the country's most iconic bluegrass venues: the Grand Ol' Opry, the Station Inn, and beyond.</p>

          <h1>Brew Davis</h1>
          <h2>From Music City, USA</h2>
          <p>Brew Davis grew up in the shadow of the Bluebird Cafe. He studied poetry and listened to his grandfather lead a cappella worship in church. The songs of Music City seeped in his bones and came out through pen and paper. In high school he fell in love with the sounds of the Nashville Bluegrass Band, Robert Earl Keen, Doc Watson and Sam Bush, and landed his dream job during college, working at the seminal roots label Sugar Hill Records in Durham, NC. All of these forces converged to create the unique blend of "Nick & Brewgrass" music.</p>
